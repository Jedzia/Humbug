// This file defines the messages into categories
// The messages will be displayed, under the category they
// are listed under here. The categories will be listed in
// the order they first appear in
//
// For legacy projects, I recommend running PC-LINT on the 
// entire project, then moving each message from the generated 
// "OTHER" category to a specific category, until there are no 
// messages in the "OTHER" category.

// New categories can easily be created simply by listing them
// here, starting with a "$$" in column 1, followed by the
// category name 

// Any messages not defined here, will appear
// in the output under the category "Other"

$$OTHER - Messages that haven't been defined in a category 
// all undefined messages will appear under this section
// This section will automatically be defined, if it isn't
// defined here. 

$$Critical Errors // These messages clearly indicate a bug, should be fixed
    // Some examples of critical error messages
	// sprintf related messages
	557   unrecognized format  -- The format string supplied to
	558   number of arguments inconsistent with format 
	559   size of argument number Integer inconsistent with format

$$Less Critical Errors // These messages indicate a possible bug, schedule for code clean-up

$$Noise Messages // These messages have been looked at and are low-priority fixups
