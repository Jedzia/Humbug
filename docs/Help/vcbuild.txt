Default Behavior:
===============================================================================
If no project is specified, and there is only a single .vcproj file in the
directory, that project will be built.
If no configuration is specified, and the VCBUILD_DEFAULT_CFG environment
variable is set, the configuration it specifies will be built. If it is not
set, then all configurations will be built.

The default action is to build the specified configurations without cleaning.

Options will also be read from the VCBUILD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS environment
variable.
